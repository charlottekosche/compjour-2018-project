## Can crowdfunding save journalism?
(title subject to change)

### Elevator Pitch
I would like to build a web app that provides data on all the journalism projects that have raised money on Kickstarter's website since the website's inception in 2009. People could use this web app to gain insights into crowdfunded journalism and how Kickstarter — which is only one example for crowdfunding websites that journalists use —  has or has not contributed to journalists' success. This project might be particularly interesting for journalists and people who work on the topic of journalism, but it might also be interesting to "news consumers" who are interested to see how and which journalistic projects are being funded on Kickstarter.

### Inspirations and prior work
* Kicktraq: https://kicktraq.com: A site that collects and analyses data on all projects on Kickstarter
* Graphtreon: https://graphtreon.com/patreon-stats: A site that scrapes and analysis all Patreon projects. They also have CSV files for download for every day since March 2015
* Through the Cracks: http://throughcracks.com/about-us/: A site that analysis journalistic crowfunding projects, in a qualitative, less data-driven way

### Comparison between prior work and my project  
* My project will be similar to the above examples, in that it anaylses data from Kickstarter (like Kicktraq) and focuses on journalism projects (like Through the Cracks). It is different in the sense that no project has ever before scraped and made accessible data on crowdfunded journalism projects before.

### Articles
* Nearly two-thirds of funded Kickstarter journalism projects based in the U.S.: http://www.journalism.org/2016/01/20/crowdfunded-journalism/pj_2016-01-20_kickstarter_0-13/

### Data sources
* CSV file with data scraped from Kickstarter's website: all journalism projects since 2009
* other complementary data, for example statistics on all Kickstarter projects in general: http://icopartners.com/2018/01/kickstarter-2017-year-review/
* Maybe this data might be helpful, although I'm not sure anymore whether we said the source is reliable: https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/
